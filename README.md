terminal1 $ npm install
terminal1 $ node start-service.js
(start a new terminal when you see "Microservice listening at http://localhost:3001")
terminal2 $ node test-service.mjs 

then in terminal1, you should get a bunch of logs like this:
openWindows() await time:  3.9703000000008615
expand the terminal output as much as possible, take a screenshot and send it to me
